*.lock files in the package manager (NPM/Yarn/Composer) are used to make sure that all people working on the project are *locked* with the same versions of the packages installed for the project. This makes sure that there's no bugs caused by different package versions used between the team members.

Indexes, in short, are a form of mapping/structuring the data in the database which vastly increases the speed in which it can be looked up/retrieved. The basis of their work is that they store a primary key (usually, although the indexed field can also be a non-primary key, or there can be a second indexed field, then it'd be called a compound index) and a pointer to the row. During a query this index table (consisting of indexed field and a pointer) is used to scan through the records and retrieve data faster.

> Key / Index

Key and index in the table and synonymous but it's possible to create a table where the indexed field is not a primary key (although it's not usually the case).

> Types of indexes

The types of indexes that I'm aware of are: 
 - clustered
 If you add a primary key to a table it becomes a clustered index. Clustered index means the data is indexed and sorted in a sequential order.

 - non-clustered
 (never used those so had to look up) Whereas the clustered index stores a primary key and a pointer to the block, the non-clustered index stores a field value and a pointer to the actual row. It results in it taking more memory on disk. It's also slower than using a clustered index.

> When to use non-clustered indexes

 Non-clustered index would be used when there's more than one field that's indexed, because there can only be one clustered index per table.
